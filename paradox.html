			<h1>Paradox Interactive</h1>
			<h2 id=year>2013 - 2014</h2>
			
			<div class=text>
				<p>I spent nearly a year as a 3D Artist intern at the Paradox South studio in Skövde, Sweden.</p>

				<p>Using Maya, Zbrush and Photoshop, I designed and modelled 3D characters for the flagship grand strategy games Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings II.</p>

				<p>I had great fun at Paradox. The teams were small and dynamic, so it was a rewarding experience to have a direct impact on the games that I was already passionate about.</p>

				<p>This is just a small collection of the projects I worked on!</p>

			<div class=text>
				<p>For the Saxon Unit Pack I used an extra UV set and a special shader so these huscarls dynamically have their king's heraldry emblazoned on their shields. This makes them look nicer, but it also improves player interface.</p>

			<div class=text>
				<p>Armies are represented by small animated models on the map. I skinned all my models to a rig built by the animation team. All the characters for this game are designed so their details have clarity even from a distance.</p>

			<div class=text>
				<p>The sandbox nature of CK2 can lead to very ahistorical situations. It was fun to model fantasy characters for the Warriors of Faith Unit Pack, such as these Pagan crusaders poised to ravage Christendom!</p>
				<p><em>Deus vult?</em></p>

			<div class=text>
				<p>It was challenging to condense India into just one set of warriors. For the Rajas of India expansion, I carefully selected elements from a variety of cultures so they could be used for Hindus, Muslims and even Buddhists!</p>
			</div>

			<div class=text>
				<p>Civilian politicians are apparently just as important as warriors. Each of these Indian councillors were designed with a personality to suit their career. I was being a bit cheeky by making a spymaster with some sort of a ninja turban, but I think it does a good job of showing his unsavoury ambitions!</p>

			<div class=text>
				<p>As with other RTS games, CK2 characters are designed with very bright player colours. This is so players could easily tell friend from foe at all zoom levels.</p>
